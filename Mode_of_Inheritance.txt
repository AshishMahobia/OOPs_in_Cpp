What scope of attributes of parents will be inherited to child class and with what scope?

	        Derived Class	Derived Class	Derived Class
Base Class	Private Mode 	Protected Mode	Public Mode
Private 	Not Inherited	Not Inherited	Not Inherited
Protected	Private 	    Protected 	    Protected
Public	    Private 	    Protected 	    Public   

Think of Protected like it can be inherited in the derived class but act as private when we access through main class

* When I am creating object the first thing that will happen is the base class ctor called and then derived class 
* But In case of destruction the derived class dtor called first then base class just opposite as ctor calling mechanism
